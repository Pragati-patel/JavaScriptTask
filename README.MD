## Introduction

This repository is about calculating the distance, displacement and direction of a girl `Pragati` traveling to her office from home.

While walking, she turns either to `North`, `South`, `East` or `West` and covers a certain distance.

The route she follows:

1. She starts walking toward `East` and covers a distance of `300m`,
2. Then she turns to `South` and covers a distance of again `300m`,
3. She now turns to `East` and covers a distance of `450m`,
4. She turns to `North` and now covers a long distance of `700m`,
5. After that she turns to `East` again and walks for `500m`,
6. Again turning to `North` and walking for `50m`,
7. Lastly she turns to `West` and walks for `15m` and reaches her office.

Based on this there are different tasks for which you have to write the code and generate the output according to the task. The task are given below:

1. Calculate total distance covered: Complete the function in file `calculateTotalDistance.js` with your stunning logic to calculate the total distance she covered in her journey.
2. Get the direction she is facing: Complete the function in file `getFacingDirection.js` and inform us about the direction she is facing now.

## Code of Conduct

As this repository is just for learning purposes, so complete the given task `daily` and create pull requests from `your branch` to the `main` branch. You will get tasks when you complete the old ones. These tasks will be based on `function`, `objects`, `currying`, `classes`, `modules` and many more ðŸ˜„.
